## About The Project

Having apps that are just how I like is a important thing for me. And since no app is fully customizable, I like to create my own to have that level of freedom.
As a bonus, I get to learn react which is not a strength of me.

Things that I wanted for a calendar app:
* Combine courses, assignments, exams, projects and events into a single application that you can customize easily.
* App would remind you and keep track of progress
